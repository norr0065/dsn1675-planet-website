        <h2> Jupiter</h2>
        <p> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian or outer planets. The planet was known by astronomers of ancient times.[11] The Romans named the planet after the Roman god Jupiter.[12] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough to cast shadows,[13] and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. (Mars can briefly match Jupiter's brightness at certain points in its orbit.)<p>

The white oval storm directly below the Great Red Spot is approximately the same diameter as Earth.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>The oval object rotates counterclockwise, with a period of about six days.[53] The Great Red Spot's dimensions are 24–40,000 km × 12–14,000 km. It is large enough to contain two or three planets of Earth's diameter.[54] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8 km (5 mi) above the surrounding cloudtops.</figcaption>
